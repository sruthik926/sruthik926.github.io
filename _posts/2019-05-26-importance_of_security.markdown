I am really enjoying my journey here at Flatiron.  I would like to explore cybersecurity at some point.  Security is certainly an important aspect of software engineering. I believe that it is essential for developers to implement security features to their apps. I think it's also important for developers to try and make their apps more user friendly.  As a user of an app, I would want to make sure that my information is protected, whether it be login credentials, or other personal data such as bank information....anything that is confidential information.  There are certain techniques that are used to tighten security.  Few of these methods include two factor authentication.  I believe two factor authentication has been around for a while now.  Two factor authentication requires users to provide information in addition to the login credentials.  This additional information usually includes a code. Users usually receive this code via text or email. Users then enter this code into the app to gain access to it.  Two factor authentication provides another level of security.  In my opinion, this additional level of security is good to have. According to studies, attacks still take place even with implentation of two factor authentication. This is something for us, developers, to think about. Perhaps, it is difficult for us to prevent attacs 100%. I think it's great that there methods such as two factor authentication exists.  Technology has advanced over the years. I am sure it will continue to advance.
