Til now, I have known the concept of 'redirecting to' a different web page. I have seen the 'redirecting to' message while browsing pages.  I have noticed being redirected to another page while navigating through a website. I understand that having too many 'redirects' can slow down the speed of the web application. However, I learned that there are tools to make this process more efficient and provide better user experience. That's so called AJAX.  With AJAX(which stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML), users do not have to refresh the page while navigating through the website. I think it's a neat tool to use for developers as well as users. I guess there is an interesting and valid point about AJAX. I didn;t quite think about this but AJAX may run behind the scenes at a speed. However, if the server is slow and the internet connection is slow, then it may take a little longer for the server to come back with a response. I am so happy to know about tools like AJAX. I look forward to implementing it to my Rails-JS project.
